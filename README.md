# Draw Line Chart dynamically using HTML5 Canvas feature.

With the ongoing progress of HTML5 and its powerful specifications, web developers have gained the ability to do things that were impossible in the past. Drawing graphics and creating animations directly in the browser is now completely possible thanks to a technology called HTML5 Canvas. Canvas is used by writing JavaScript that can access the canvas area through a full set of drawing functions, thus allowing for dynamically generated graphics. In this tutorial I am trying to present sketch Line Chart using HTML5 Canvas where the line chart values will be populated from the input form field.  

## Installation

Clone the project from the Github repository and run your Webserver. Open the project the to web browser.

## Conclusion
The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. It is a low level, procedural model that updates a bitmap and does not have a built-in scene graph. Here is am trying to present to draw the line chart that’s values can be dynamically input by the user. You can use this line chart for any visual representation of the statically data. So keep going with canvas and Happy coding…:)
